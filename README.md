# BadWindows

BadWindows, is the PHP version of [SharpLocker](https://github.com/Pickfordmatt/SharpLocker).  
It was created for educational purposes to show that even a web attack implemented correctly can still grab passwords.

Passwords entered into the form are sent to a request bin --> [requestbin.net](http://requestbin.net)  
And therefore, can be accessed remotely.

## Important

As of 20/10/2022, BadWindows is only supported on Windows 10.

If you would like to contribute to add support for other versions of Windows, please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/arsenstorm/BadWindows/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
